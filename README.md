The proposed solution, PRAGATI – Precision Retrieval & AI for Generative Agriculture Technology & Insights – is a
RAG-Powered Multi-Agent Intelligence System tailored to agricultural domain knowledge. At its core, the
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline integrates semantic search with domain-specific knowledge base
retrieval, ensuring all AI-generated responses are grounded in verified agricultural data. This enables precise, timely,
and context-aware recommendations through specialized AI agents for crop selection, irrigation, fertilizer use, pest
detection, weather forecasting, and market price analysis.
PRAGATI employs query complexity assessment to optimize retrieval and generation, while multi-agent
orchestration ensures the right expertise is applied to each query. Its multi-lingual and multi-modal capabilities
(text, image, and voice inputs) make it accessible to a wide range of users. Deep research pipelines enhance
coverage, and a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) mechanism validates outputs for factual accuracy and trustworthiness,
ensuring reliable decision support for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.
