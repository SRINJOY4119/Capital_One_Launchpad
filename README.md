# Capital_One_Launchpad

PRITHVI (Pipelined Retrieval & Intelligent Tooling for Holistic & Versatile Insights in Agriculture) is a resilient AI Agent Orchestrator built on a domain-tuned Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and query-complexity-driven orchestration, integrating high-capability reasoning models (e.g., **Gemini-2.5-Pro**) for complex, multi-hop decisions and **offline fallbacks (AgriPARM, Qwen-1.5–1.8B)** for no-internet operation. It delivers context-aware recommendations across crop selection, irrigation, fertilizer optimization, pest and disease detection, yield forecasting, weather advisories, and market analysis while mitigating hallucination via multi-source fact-checking and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) validation. PRITHVI’s tooling layer includes: **Fertilizer Recommendation Tool, Tavily Web Search Tool, Market Price Retrieval Tool, Weather Forecast Tool, Crop Recommendation Tool, Crop Yield Prediction Tool, Pest Detection Tool, Translation Tool,** and **Crop Disease Tool**—all invoked dynamically by specialized agents using semantic search, hybrid retrieval (FAISS+BM25), multi-modal inputs, and parallelized RAG processing to ensure accurate, accessible, and trustworthy agricultural guidance.
